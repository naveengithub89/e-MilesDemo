This project allows the user to create a temporary survey with four kinds of html elements (text box, radio button, check boxes, drop down list).

The options for each of radio buttons, check boxes and drop down list can be configured.

The user can instantly attempt to answer the survey and save the answers and then submit the survey results.

The survey results can then be viewed instantly.

This doesn't support a browser refresh as the state is not persistent since the data isn't being stored in any DB.
